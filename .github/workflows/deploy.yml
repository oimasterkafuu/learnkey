            ## Release ${{ github.ref_name }} :tada:

            Hello, there :wave: We've got release ${{ github.ref_name }} for you!

            You can download the `dist.zip` file from the Assets section below to get the automatically built static resources and deploy them to your own server.

            The SHA256 checksum of the `dist.zip` file is `${{ env.sha256 }}`. You can use this to verify the integrity of the file :lock:

            Or, you can go to the [online demo](https://learn.oimaster.top/) to view the latest production version :rocket: Remember to clear the cache of your browser if you have visited the demo before :wink:

            Enjoy! :kissing_heart:
